    "From the reconstruction, you can observe that the general structure and appearance of the face are kept while the fine details are lost. This is a remarkable reduction (more than 10x) in the dataset size that can help speed up your learning algorithm significantly. For example, if you were training a neural network to perform person recognition (given a face image, predict the identity of the person), you can use the dimension reduced input of only a 100 dimensions instead of the original pixels."
